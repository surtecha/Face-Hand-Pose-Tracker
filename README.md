This basic project uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect hand and face landmarks in real-time video streams and images. It also provides pose detection functionality.

The application will open a window displaying the real-time video stream. The **hand** landmarks, **face** landmarks and **pose** of the person in the video stream will be displayed in real-time.

This program is made possible by the following open-source libraries and models:

* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* MediaPipe Hand Landmark Model
* MediaPipe Face Landmark Model
* MediaPipe Pose Landmark Model
